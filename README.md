# Cypher_Methods

## 1. Caesar Cipher
Encryption:

+	Choose a shift value (key) from 1 to 25.
+	For each letter in the plaintext, shift it by the chosen value down the alphabet.

Decryption:

	Reverse the shift operation on the ciphertext using the same key.
	
Brute Force Attack:

+	Try all possible shift values from 1 to 25.
+	Analyze the output using frequency analysis or other heuristic techniques to find the most likely plaintext.

## 2. Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher

Encryption:

+	Choose a random one-to-one mapping of the alphabet to another set of letters.
+	Replace each letter in the plaintext with the corresponding letter from the mapping.

Decryption:

	Reverse the substitution using the inverse mapping.
	
Brute Force Attack:

+	Brute force is not practical due to 26! possible key combinations.
+	Use frequency analysis to find the most likely substitution mapping.

## 3. Vigen√®re Cipher

Encryption:

+	Choose a keyword.
+	Repeat the keyword until it matches the length of the plaintext.
+	Shift each plaintext letter by the corresponding keyword letter's position in the alphabet.


Decryption: 

1. Reverse the shift operation on the ciphertext using the corresponding keyword letter's position in the alphabet.

Brute Force Attack:

+	Try different keyword lengths. 
+	Apply frequency analysis on the resulting Caesar ciphers for each keyword length.
+	Determine the most likely keyword length based on the analysis.
+	Perform frequency analysis on each Caesar cipher to recover the keyword.
